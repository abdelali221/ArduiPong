# ArduiPong

 Pong game on the Arduino!

# Requirements : 

 - An Arduino, and that's all!

# Disclamer :

This program was tested and designed for TeraTerm 5, HyperTerminal and PuTTY (Or any VT100/ANSIW compatible Terminal, You can even use a physical Terminal with a proper adapter), using the Arduino IDE integrated Serial Monitor won't work and you'll only have a messy output.

# Controls : 

 - Start/End game : Space Bar
 - Speed UP : "+"
 - Slow DOWN : "-"

Vertical Version :
 - UP : "z"
 - DOWN : "s"

Horizontal Version :

 - LEFT : "q"
 - RIGHT : "d"

# 2 Player...

The 2 player version requires using two potentiometers, player 1 input is A0 and player 2 input is A1.

I recommend using a B10K potentiometer.
